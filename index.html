      <p id="biography">After being the second person to ever climb the empire state building upside down while doing a
        handstand and
        carrying a panda, I decided to open a bakery. A couple weeks after that due to a wild series of events, I became
        a
        web developer and have remained one while I prepare to return to the circus to be the clown my ex always said I
        was! It's been 7 years since then and I've worked for a number of companies and helped create some well known
        websites still used today! <span class="underline">If you're looking for someone who can really be an asset to
          your team, I'm your
          gal!</span>
      </p>
      <div id="TheBagel">
        <p>Something that I would like everyone to know is that I'd prefer it if you don't mention bagels to me. There
          was
          an accident a while back and I'm still recovering. I've included a photo here depicting a recreation of what
          happened to me.</p>

    <p>I'm proud to say that I've worked on many notable websites for different companies but listed below what others
      have said about me from what are perhaps
      my 3 most notable:</p>
